# Hashing
- Hashing is the process of mapping large amounts of data into a smaller value using a hash function.
- The table which stores the data is called a hash table.
- To convert the data (keys) into a hash value, we use the hash function.
- If `x` denotes the data (key) to be stored, we can say that `h(x)` denotes the hashed value, where h is the hash function.
- Different types of hash functions are
  - Division method
  - Multiplication method
  - Mid-square method

## Division method
  <p align="center">
    $h(x)=x \pmod m$ 
  </p>
  
where $m$ is the size of the hash table.

For example:
Let the size of the hash table = `7` and the `keys={52, 44, 35, 24, 10}`

<div align="center">
  
 $h(52)=52 \pmod 7 =3$
  
  $h(44)=44 \pmod 7 =2$
  
  $h(35)=35 \pmod 7 =0$
  
  $h(24)=24 \pmod 7 =3$
  
  $h(10)=10 \pmod 7 =3$
  
</div>
  
The hash table will look like:

<div align="center">
  
  |Index|Value|
  |---|---|
  |0|35|
  |1| |
  |2| 44|
  |3|52, 24, 7|
  |4| |
  |5| |
  |6| |
  
</div>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Collision**: the hash value generated by the hash function is the same for two different keys.
