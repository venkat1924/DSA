# Hashing
- Hasing is a process of mapping large amounts of data into a smaller value using a hash function.
- The table which stores the data is called a hash table.
- To convert the data (keys) into hash value, we use the hash function.
- If `x` denotes the data (key) to be stored, we can say that `h(x)` denotes the hashed value, where h is the hash function.
- DIfferent of hash functions are
  - Division method
  - Multiplication method
  - Mid-square method
