# Hashing
- Hashing is the process of mapping large amounts of data into a smaller value using a hash function.
- The table which stores the data is called a hash table.
- To convert the data (keys) into a hash value, we use the hash function.
- If `x` denotes the data (key) to be stored, we can say that `h(x)` denotes the hashed value, where h is the hash function.
- Different types of hash functions are
  - Division method
  - Multiplication method
  - Mid-square method

## Division method
  <p align="center">
    $h(x)=x.mod(m)$ 
  </p>
  
where $m$ is the size of the hash table.
