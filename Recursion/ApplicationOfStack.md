Sure, here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Recursion**: A technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
2. **Stack Frame**: Each function call creates a frame storing parameters, variables, and return address.
3. **Call Stack**: The stack of frames manages the sequence of function calls during recursion.
4. **Adding Frames**: Recursive calls create new frames stacked on top of each other.
5. **Unwinding**: When a base case is reached, frames are removed from the stack.
6. **Control Flow**: Stack ensures proper management of function calls and returns.
7. **Stack Overflow**: Too many recursive calls can exhaust stack space, leading to errors.
