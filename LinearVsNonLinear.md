| S.NO | Linear Data Structure                                                                                            | Non-linear Data Structure                                                                                       |

| 1.   | Elements are arranged in a linear order where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent.        | Elements are attached hierarchically.                             |
| 2.   | Only a single level is involved.                                                                                 | Multiple levels are involved.                                              |
| 3.   | Its implementation is easier than non-linear data structures.                                                    | Its implementation is complex in comparison to linear data structures.                                       |
| 4.   | Elements can be traversed in a single run only.                                                                  | Elements cannot be traversed in a single run only.                        |
| 5.   | Memory may not be utilized efficiently.                                                                          | Memory is generally utilized efficiently                                |
| 6.   | Useful for simple data storage and manipulation.                                                                 | Useful for representing complex relationships and data hierarchies, such as in social networks, file systems, or computer networks. |
| 7.   | Performance is usually good for simple operations like adding or removing at the ends, but slower for operations like searching or removing elements in the middle. | Performance can vary depending on the structure and the operation, but can be optimized for specific operations. |
| 8.   | Examples: array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.                                                                 | Examples: trees and graphs.                                                                       |
